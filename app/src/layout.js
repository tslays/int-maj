/**
 * Table geometry, as plain numbers: no 3D library, so the tests can check it.
 *
 * One unit is a tile's width. Each seat's things are laid out in that seat's
 * frame, as if it sat at the bottom (+z) looking at the centre; the frame is
 * then turned about the centre (rel 1 by +90 degrees, and so on).
 *
 * The discard areas form a pinwheel around the centre console. Each seat's
 * rows are exactly as wide as the console square, so the four areas meet only
 * at the corners and never overlap. Rows one to three hold six tiles; the
 * fourth row takes every later tile and runs on to the seat's right, into the
 * corner that no other seat uses.
